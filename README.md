# Suspension-System-Design-for-16-Inch-Foldable-Bicycle
This project develops a suspension system for a 16-inch foldable bicycle. Using Creo Parametric for CAD modeling and ANSYS for finite element analysis, we assess structural integrity under various loads. A MATLAB program simulates dynamic performance and optimizes settings for comfort and stability, enhancing urban usability.
