# Suspension-System-Design-for-16-Inch-Foldable-Bicycle
This project develops a suspension system for a 16-inch foldable bicycle. Using Creo Parametric for CAD modeling and ANSYS for finite element analysis, we assess structural integrity under various loads. A MATLAB program simulates dynamic performance and optimizes settings for comfort and stability, enhancing urban usability.

## Design & Assembly of model in creo

The components were assembled within Creo to ensure proper fit and integration with the bicycleâ€™s folding mechanism. Key considerations during assembly included:
i.	Interference Checks: Ensuring no components obstruct the folding action.
ii.	Alignment: Precise alignment to maintain structural integrity and performance.
